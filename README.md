# Shutdown
A program that asks you before shutting down the computer with options.

This program was created for my personal convenience.
Microsoft changed the defualt parameters for shutting down to save
the state of some programs. Which I don't like. So I made this program
in order to be able to shutdown my computer with one click.

It also asks you before actually shutting down to prevent accidents.

# How to use

1. Create a shortcut of the .exe file.
2. Then change the icon of the shortcut to something you like by going in to properties.
3. Pin the shortcut to your desktop.

# Comment

If you think that the Shutdown.exe might contain virus, you can just read
Shutdown.c and compile it yourself to be sure. _I will not take any responsibility for any damage that is done to your computer because of this program._ (Although I doubt it will. As windows will stop you from shutting down if you have unsaved work, for example.)
